Sasquatch's Hammer
Hammer
If you're considering using Sasquatch's Hammer, be ready for blood, sweat and tears. You provide the sweat, your enemies - the blood and tears. This monster drains a lot of stamina, but inflicts massive damage.
Very heavy weapon. When equipped, it significantly reduces movement speed and jump height, and prevents you from sprinting, dodging and dashing.
